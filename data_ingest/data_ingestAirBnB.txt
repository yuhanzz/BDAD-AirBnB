I first downloaded the data(listings.csv.gz(for 13 months) and neighborhood.csv and neighborhoods.geojson) from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. 

I unzipped all the listings.csv.gz file for 13 months, put them into a folder,and rezipped the folder. Then, I copied the zipped folder into dumbo.es.its.nyu.edu using an application, FileZilla. 

FileZilla input: 
	host: dumbo.es.its.nyu.edu
	Username: lh2978
	Password:
	Port: 22 
	

I unzipped the folder and copied the folder into hdfs with the commands: 

hdfs dfs -mkdir "project/data"
hdfs dfs -put "listings" "project/data"
